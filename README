Perl Beginner Talks
===================

This is a collection of slidedecks for talks that are designed to be
given as part of a "Beginner" or "Zero To Perl" type track at a Perl
conference or workshop.

Each directory corresponds to a particular talk topic; within each
directory there are one or more slide decks as well as a README file
describing when each slide deck originated and the different times the
corresponding talk has been delivered.

Contributions Welcome!

you'd rather let somebody else do the heavy lifting, email your
slidedeck to genehack@genehack.org.
